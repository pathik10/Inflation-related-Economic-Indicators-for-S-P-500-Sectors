# Inflation-related-Economic-Indicators-for-S-P-500-Sectors
The research projectâ€™s goal was to provide an automatic interpretation of the influence of inflation-related economic indicators on various S&amp;P 500 sectors. Multiple machine learning models were implemented to predict the 50, 100, and 200 days relative performance of all 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index using related CPI data.
